## CSCI-411 Final Project
# Cooley-Tukey algorithm for FFT

---

fft.cpp contains my implementation of the FFT algorithm. 
wavegen.cpp is used to create some pure sinewaves for testing. 
Also contained in the testing directory are some files I downloaded
of musical notes on a few instruments.

The only dependency is libsnfile. The following command will install
libsndfile via apt.

```
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
```
